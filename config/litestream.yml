# This is the actual configuration file for litestream.
#
# You can either use the generated `config/initializers/litestream.rb`
# file to configure the litestream-ruby gem, which will populate these
# ENV variables when using the `rails litestream:replicate` command.
#
# Or, if you prefer, manually manage ENV variables and this configuration file.
# In that case, simply ensure that the ENV variables are set before running the
# `replicate` command.
